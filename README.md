# NOAA_Weather_Data_Analysis_JFK_Airport_-New_York-
This notebook focuses on analyzing and forecasting weather patterns using the NOAA Weather Dataset collected from JFK Airport. 114,546 hourly observations of 12 key climatological variables, like temperature, wind speed, humidity, pressure. Sample data is extracted, cleaned, analyzed and predicts weather trends for scheduling better flight times.
The notebook is organized into three main parts:

**Part 1: Data Cleaning**
Here, the raw data is prepared for analysis by:
Removing unnecessary or redundant columns to retain only relevant numerical features
Converting data types and cleaning inconsistencies
Handling missing values with appropriate filling strategies
Encoding categorical weather features for downstream analysis

**Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Here, visual and statistical exploration of the cleaned dataset is performed:
Load the cleaned data
Generate insightful visualizations of key variables
Identify trends, patterns, and seasonal effects in the time-series data

**Part 3: Time Series Forecasting**
Here, the focus on predicting future temperatures using time-series models:**
Load the cleaned and preprocessed data
Establish baseline forecasting models
Train and evaluate advanced statistical forecasting techniques
